# Lox language
Implementation of the lox language in clojure. Lox is based on
[crafting-interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Why
I created this to learn clojure.
It is not idiomatic clojure in any way.

## Todos:
* Refactor scanner to use more idiomatic clojure
* Error handling in scanner
